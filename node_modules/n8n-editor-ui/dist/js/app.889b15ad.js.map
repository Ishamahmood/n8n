By contrast, the GNU General Public\n * License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n * software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n * General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n * Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n * using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n * the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n * your programs, too.\n *\n *   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n * price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n * have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n * this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n * if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n * in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n *\n *   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n * anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n * These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n * distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n *\n *   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n * gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n * you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n * source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n * rights.\n *\n *   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n * (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n * distribute and/or modify the software.\n *\n *   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n * that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n * software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n * want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n * that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n * authors' reputations.\n *\n *   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n * patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n * program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n * program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n * patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n *\n *   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n * modification follow.\n *\n *         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n *    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n *\n *   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n * a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n * under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n * refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n * means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n * that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n * either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n * language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n * the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n *\n * Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n * covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n * running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n * is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n * Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n * Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n *\n *   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n * source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n * conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n * copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n * notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n * and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n * along with the Program.\n *\n * You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n * you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n *\n *   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n * of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n * distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n * above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n *\n *     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n *     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n *\n *     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n *     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n *     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n *     parties under the terms of this License.\n *\n *     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n *     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n *     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n *     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n *     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n *     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n *     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n *     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n *     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n *     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n *\n * These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n * and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n * themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n * sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n * distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n * on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n * this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n * entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n *\n * Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n * your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n * exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n * collective works based on the Program.\n *\n * In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n * with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n * a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n * the scope of this License.\n *\n *   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n * under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n * Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n *\n *     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n *     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n *     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n *\n *     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n *     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n *     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n *     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n *     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n *     customarily used for software interchange; or,\n *\n *     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n *     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n *     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n *     received the program in object code or executable form with such\n *     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n *\n * The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n * making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n * code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n * associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n * control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n * special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n * anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n * form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n * operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n * itself accompanies the executable.\n *\n * If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n * access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n * access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n * distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n * compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n *\n *   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n * except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n * otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n * void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n * However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n * this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n * parties remain in full compliance.\n *\n *   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n * signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n * distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n * prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n * modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n * Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n * all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n * the Program or works based on it.\n *\n *   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n * Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n * original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n * these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n * restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n * You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n * this License.\n *\n *   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n * excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n * distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n * License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n * may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n * license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n * all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n * the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n * refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n *\n * If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n * any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n * apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n * circumstances.\n *\n * It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n * patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n * such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n * integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n * implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n * generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n * through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n * system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n * to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n * impose that choice.\n *\n * This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n * be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n *\n *   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n * certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n * original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n * may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n * those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n * countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n * the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n *\n *   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n * of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n * be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n * address new problems or concerns.\n *\n * Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n * specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n * later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n * either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n * Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n * this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n * Foundation.\n *\n *   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n * programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n * to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n * Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n * make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n * of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n * of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n *\n *           NO WARRANTY\n *\n *   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n * FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n * PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\n * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\n * TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n * License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n * software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n * General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n * Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n * using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n * the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n * your programs, too.\n *\n *   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n * price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n * have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n * this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n * if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n * in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n *\n *   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n * anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n * These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n * distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n *\n *   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n * gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n * you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n * source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n * rights.\n *\n *   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n * (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n * distribute and/or modify the software.\n *\n *   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n * that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n * software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n * want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n * that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n * authors' reputations.\n *\n *   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n * patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n * program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n * program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n * patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n *\n *   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n * modification follow.\n *\n *         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n *    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n *\n *   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n * a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n * under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n * refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n * means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n * that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n * either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n * language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n * the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n *\n * Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n * covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n * running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n * is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n * Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n * Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n *\n *   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n * source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n * conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n * copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n * notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n * and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n * along with the Program.\n *\n * You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n * you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n *\n *   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n * of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n * distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n * above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n *\n *     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n *     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n *\n *     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n *     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n *     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n *     parties under the terms of this License.\n *\n *     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n *     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n *     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n *     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n *     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n *     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n *     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n *     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n *     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n *     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n *\n * These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n * and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n * themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n * sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n * distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n * on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n * this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n * entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n *\n * Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n * your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n * exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n * collective works based on the Program.\n *\n * In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n * with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n * a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n * the scope of this License.\n *\n *   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n * under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n * Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n *\n *     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n *     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n *     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n *\n *     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n *     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n *     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n *     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n *     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n *     customarily used for software interchange; or,\n *\n *     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n *     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n *     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n *     received the program in object code or executable form with such\n *     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n *\n * The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n * making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n * code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n * associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n * control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n * special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n * anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n * form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n * operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n * itself accompanies the executable.\n *\n * If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n * access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n * access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n * distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n * compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n *\n *   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n * except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n * otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n * void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n * However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n * this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n * parties remain in full compliance.\n *\n *   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n * signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n * distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n * prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n * modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n * Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n * all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n * the Program or works based on it.\n *\n *   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n * Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n * original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n * these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n * restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n * You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n * this License.\n *\n *   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n * excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n * distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n * License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n * may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n * license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n * all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n * the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n * refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n *\n * If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n * any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n * apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n * circumstances.\n *\n * It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n * patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n * such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n * integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n * implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n * generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n * through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n * system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n * to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n * impose that choice.\n *\n * This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n * be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n *\n *   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n * certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n * original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n * may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n * those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n * countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n * the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n *\n *   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n * of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n * be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n * address new problems or concerns.\n *\n * Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n * specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n * later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n * either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n * Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n * this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n * Foundation.\n *\n *   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n * programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n * to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n * Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n * make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n * of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n * of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n *\n *           NO WARRANTY\n *\n *   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n * FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n * PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\n * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\n * TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
